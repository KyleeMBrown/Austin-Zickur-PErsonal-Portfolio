                      My journey as a first-generation scholar has been marked by an unwavering dedication to my academic pursuits. 
                      I have always possessed an innate aptitude for theory, which I have nurtured and expanded upon throughout my educational journey. 
                      From my early years at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy to my rigorous studies in Aerospace Engineering and Astronomy 
                      during my undergraduate years, I have been driven by a deep passion for learning and a relentless pursuit of knowledge.
                     <br><br>
                     My mechanical intuition, which has its roots in my childhood experiences watching my father work on cars, 
                     has been an invaluable asset in my academic and personal life. It has enabled me to approach problems with a unique perspective, 
                     often leading to innovative solutions and creative thinking. This hands-on approach to problem-solving has shaped my identity as a 
                     scholar who is not afraid to get their hands dirty and tinker with concepts until they gain a profound understanding.
                     <br><br>
                     In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also deeply involved in various extracurricular activities that align with my passions
                      and values. My role as the Membership Director on the board of Minorities in Aerospace at the University of Illinois 
                      Urbana-Champaign allows me to make a meaningful impact in promoting diversity and inclusion within the aerospace industry. 
                      My commitment to learning, my passion for problem-solving, and my dedication to making a positive impact in my community are
                       all facets of who I am as a passionate contributor and future engineer.
                       <br><br>
                       Beyond my academic and professional interests, I have a rich and fulfilling personal life. Playing competitive Overwatch with my 
                       girlfriend in the top 10% brings both enjoyment and a sense of teamwork. We make the competition a shared experience that 
                       strengthens our relationship and communication. I also find great meaning in listening to music, working out to maintain a 
                       healthy body and mind, and experimenting in the kitchen. I love everything cinematic Marvel and have found so much value in 
                       analyzing TV and film.

                          I have strong capabilities in python programming and Siemens NX computer aided design, 
                          specifically, which is utilized in many of my completed projects. I also have experience 
                          in MATLAB, Command Language, SolidWorks, and some simulation software open sourced for basic 
                          inquiry. I love utilizing code and linear algebra to obtain extremely useful techniques. For
                           example, my favorite project was coding a Linear Quadratic Regulator state feedback controller 
                           for a single-axled dynamical chassis system. Another of my most validating experiences is my 
                           materials lab for Applied Aerospace Structures where I tested uniaxial stress and strain. The 
                           piece of the sample I kept, highlighting the difference in stress between the outer and inner 
                           material gradients, serves as a tangible reminder of my commitment to deep understanding and 
                           exploration.

                          Utilizing world-class institutions at UIUC has not only enriched my education, but has also 
                          given me the opportunity to develop professionally and socially. My Astronomy Research Seminar 
                          serves as the cornerstone of my initiative towards meaningful development. I have completed 
                          technical writing classes as well as excelled in my electives, which I have often chosen as 400 
                          level courses to my professors’ surprise. I am constantly striving to extract significance from 
                          my surroundings and often find that critical thinking is a vital skill developed by comparison 
                          or recognition.

                          which I helped found with a few close friends. Together, we transformed MAERO from an isolated 
                          club into a Registered Student Organization (RSO), and we were successful in securing 
                          sponsorship and mentorship from Blue Origin. Under this umbrella, I have worked on passion
                           projects like Hummingbird, Ascension, and Flight, all with the ambitious goal of reaching 
                           fruition by the fourth quarter 2023/2024 academic year. My specific contributions include 
                           ArduPilot and Navio HAT autopilot calibration for control systems design of Raspberry 
                           Pi-powered flight. Additionally, I collaborated on an outreach program involving a flapping 
                           robot design project with testing at the University’s wind tunnel and led another, emphasizing 
                           the importance of linear algebra and application of control in engineering. Communication, 
                           teamwork, and networking are crucial, honed skills for success, but the holistic belief is in 
                           redefining ability and realizing the individual.

                          fields exemplified by places like FermiLab. This is a dream come true, especially considering
